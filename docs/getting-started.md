# Getting started

## Installation

### Prerequisites

MoMEMta depends on the following libraries and tools:

 - LHAPDF (>=6)
 - CMake (>=3.2)
 - Boost (>=1.54)
 - ROOT (>=5.34.09)
 - A C++11-capable compiler

!!! note
    MoMEMta has only been tested on GNU/Linux.

### Compilation

Retrieve the code on [our github repository](https://github.com/MoMEMta/MoMEMta/releases). Unpack the archive and / or go to the `MoMEMta` directory. Next, execute the following:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 4
```

Finally, make MoMEMta (public headers and library) available using:
```bash
make install
```

You can now use MoMEMta  with your own code.

### Build options

The following options are available when configuring the build (when running `cmake ..`):

   * `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=(path)`: Install MoMEMta in a specific location when running `make install` (useful if you don't have admin rights)
   * `-DPROFILING=ON`: Generate debugging symbols and profiling information (requires `gperftools`)
   * `-DBOOST_ROOT=(path)`: Use specific Boost version (path to its install directory)
   * `-DTESTS=ON`: Also compile the test executables
   * `-DEXAMPLES=OFF`: Do not compile the example executables


## Usage: Lua & MoMEMta

In MoMEMta, the computation of weights is configured by the user through a small script written in the Lua language. Don’t be scared though: no previous knowledge of Lua is needed to use MoMEMta!

Computing weights in your analysis code is then a matter of only a few lines of C++: read the Lua file, instantiate MoMEMta, and call it by passing your particle 4-vectors:

```cpp
#include <momemta/ConfigurationReader.h>
#include <momemta/Logging.h>
#include <momemta/MoMEMta.h>
#include <momemta/Utils.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv) {

    ConfigurationReader configuration("tt_fullyleptonic.lua");
    MoMEMta weight(configuration.freeze());

    LorentzVector p3(16.17, -13.79, -3.43, 21.53);
    LorentzVector p4(-55.79, -111.59, -122.14, 174.66);
    LorentzVector p5(-18.90, 10.09, -0.60, 21.43);
    LorentzVector p6(71.39, 96.01, -77.25, 142.50);

    std::vector<std::pair<double, double>> weights = weight.computeWeights({p3, p4, p5, p6});

    std::cout << "Result: " << weights.back().first << " +- " << weights.back().second;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Examples

We ship a few example configuration files, along with short scripts computing a single weight: find them in `MoMEMta/examples`. To run them, simply call them from the `build` directory:

```
./tt_fullyleptonic.exe
./tt_fullyleptonic_NWA.exe
./WW_fullyleptonic.exe
```

A set of more comprehensive examples on how to run MoMEMta can be found in our [Tutorials repository](https://github.com/MoMEMta/Tutorials). Each of these examples includes a matrix element generated by our exporter, a ROOT file containing a few events, a Lua configuration file and a small source code showing how to compute weights for the events in the sample.

## Matrix elements

MoMEMta includes matrix elements for a few processes, but you might soon want to compute weights for other processes. It is possible to include matrix elements for any process by using our [Matrix Element Exporter](https://github.com/MoMEMta/MoMEMta-MaGMEE), a plugin for [MadGraph5_aMC@NLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) (MG5). The plugin takes a leading-order matrix element generated by MG5 and exports it in a format suitable for use in MoMEMta. More information on how to use the plugin and the resulting matrix elements is provided in the plugin’s [README file](https://github.com/MoMEMta/MoMEMta-MaGMEE/blob/master/README.md). 

Support for other matrix element generators is planned for futures releases.
