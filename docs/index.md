# The MoMEMta project

**MoMEMta** is a C++ software package to compute Matrix Element weights. Designed in a modular way, it covers the needs of the experimental analysis workflows at the LHC. MoMEMta provides working examples for the most common final states ($\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}$, WW, ...). If you are expert user, be prepared to feel the freedom of configure your MEM computation at all levels.

MoMEMta is based on:

 - C++, ROOT, Lua scripting language
 - Cuba library for integration
 - External PDFs (LHAPDF by default)
 - External Matrix Element (provided with MadGraph C++ exporter)
