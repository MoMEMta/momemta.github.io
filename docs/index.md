# The MoMEMta project

<img alt="MoMEMta logo" src="images/full_logo.png" style="display:block; margin: auto" />

**MoMEMta** is a C++ software package to compute Matrix Element weights. Designed in a modular way, it covers the needs of experimental analysis workflows at the LHC. MoMEMta provides working examples for the most common final states ($\text{t}\bar{\text{t}}$, WW, …). If you are an expert user, be prepared to feel the freedom of configuring your MEM computation at all levels.

MoMEMta is based on:

 - C++, ROOT, Lua scripting language
 - Cuba (Monte-Carlo integration library)
 - External PDFs (LHAPDF by default)
 - External Matrix Element (provided by our MadGraph C++ exporter plugin)

You will probably want to start with our [getting started guide](getting-started.md).
