# The MoMEMta project

**MoMEMta** is a software package designed in a modular way to cover the needs of the experimental analysis workflows at the LHC. MoMEMta provides working examples for the most common final states (ttbar, WW, ...). If you are expert user, be prepared to feel the freedom of configure your MEM computation at all levels.

MoMEMta is based on:

 - C++, ROOT, Lua scripting language
 - Cuba library for integration
 - External PDFs (LHAPDF by default)
 - External Matrix Element (provided with MadGraph C++ exporter)
